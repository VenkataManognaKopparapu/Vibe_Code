## Unsplash Random Background

This application integrates the Unsplash API to display a random scenery image as the background each time a new fact is generated.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Unsplash Developer Account

### Setup

1. Create an Unsplash Developer Account

   - Fill out the application details
   - Once approved, go to your "Applications" section
   - Create a new application
   - Copy your "Access Key"

2. Set the Unsplash API Key
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root
   - Add the following line:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here
     ```
   - IMPORTANT: Never commit this file to version control
   - Add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore`

### Troubleshooting

- **No Images Appearing?**
  - Verify your Unsplash API Access Key is correct
  - Check browser console for any error messages
  - Ensure you have an active internet connection
  - Confirm your Unsplash application has been approved

### Features
